# CS-465-Full-Stack-Development-I

* Architecture
    * Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
      * Express is a Node.js framework that allows for the efficient development of Node-based applications. The frontend customer side application of the project was developed using Express, a node.js-based framework. handlebars were used to create templates and render the HTML pages. Angular was utilized for the single-page application (SPA) and it is a frontend framework that is perfect for building SPAs. A SPA works by first taking the HTTP request sent by the user to the site and responding with everything needed to render the webpage and its functions. JavaScript is a programming language that is widely used for front-end development.
  
    * Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
      * A NoSQL with MongoDB was chosen because it provides speed, structure, and functionality. MongoDB works well with both JSON and JavaScript as well making it a great fit for a MEAN application. The backend utilizes a NoSQL MongoDB database due to the speed and structure that it provides.

* Functionality
    * How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
      * JavaScript is a programming language with a variety of applications. JSON is a data transmission format. An HTTP request contains JSON data that allows an API request to receive a proper response to be understood by a compiler. JSON is used for the front end when a user makes an HTTP request and the back end when the request is received, and a response is sent.
     
    * Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.
      * Reusable user interface components are important to reduce the complexity of code and the chance for errors. This also allows for more efficient development of projects and keeps the design for UX/UI designers more simplistic and ensures the proper application development best practices can be easily followed. 
 
* Testing
    * Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
      * Testing the application was conducted via error codes in the console log, log messages, and running a live debug server. The error codes tell you what failed, and the log messages tell how why they failed. Security of the endpoints in full-stack development is extremely important. In this application, the sensitive API Methods (POST and PUT) are placed in a check to verify the user was logged in. The methods and endpoints in the application all provide calls to the database, The PUT issues an edit call, the POST issues a create call, the GET issues a read call, and the DELETE issues a delete call.

* Reflection
    * How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
      * CS 465 has taught me a lot about developing a website from the front-end and back-end. I increase my skills in problem-solving, researching, critical thinking, and detail. Iâ€™ve learned how to develop a website using Express and a SPA using Angular. Additionally, I have finetuned my ability to send requests using java to a NoSQL database.
